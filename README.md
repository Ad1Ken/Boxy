# Game Overview: Boxy

Objective: The goal of Boxy is to guide your character from the starting point to the flag by navigating through a series of boxes. The challenge lies in rotating and flipping these boxes to create a clear path for your character.
Game Mechanics:

    Box Interaction:
        Single Click: When you click on a box, it rotates 90 degrees. The rotation will allow you to adjust the position of the small window within the box.
        Double Click: Double-clicking on a box flips it. This action can change the orientation of the window, allowing you to approach the puzzle from a different angle.

    The Window:
        Each box has a small window that acts as a passage. The window must be aligned correctly with adjacent boxes to enable your character to pass through. Your task is to rotate or flip the boxes to align these windows in such a way that your character can move from one box to the next.

    Strategic Path Creation:
        The game requires careful planning and foresight. As you rotate and flip the boxes, you'll need to think several steps ahead to ensure that each box's window aligns properly, allowing your character to continue progressing toward the flag.

    Challenge:
        As the levels progress, the number of boxes increases, and the complexity of their arrangement becomes more challenging. Some levels may introduce additional obstacles or constraints, such as limited rotations or time limits, adding an extra layer of difficulty.

Winning the Game:

    Level Completion: You win each level by successfully guiding your character from the start point to the flag, navigating through all the boxes by rotating and flipping them to create an uninterrupted path.

Tips for Success:

    Plan Ahead: Before making any moves, consider the positions of all the boxes and how the windows align. Each rotation or flip should bring you closer to forming a complete path.
    Experiment: Don’t be afraid to try different rotations and flips. Sometimes, the solution requires a combination of actions that might not be immediately obvious.
    Efficiency: Aim to complete each level with the fewest moves possible. This not only challenges your strategic thinking but also adds to the satisfaction of mastering each puzzle.

Game Flow:

    Start: The level begins with your character positioned at the starting point with windows in various orientations.
    Interact: Click or double-click on the boxes to rotate or flip them. Watch how the windows change positions and plan your next move accordingly.
    Navigate: Once you’ve aligned the windows correctly, guide your character through the boxes to the flag.
    Victory: Reaching the flag completes the level. Celebrate your success and move on to the next, more challenging puzzle!

Boxy is a game of strategy, patience, and spatial awareness. Each level is a new puzzle waiting to be solved. Good luck!
